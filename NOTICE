PURPOSE
--------
wsman-guardian is a **defensive, passive inspection toolkit** for analyzing WS-Man / CIM (SOAP over HTTP/HTTPS)
traffic in secure environments. It enables defenders to observe, redact, and correlate management-plane network
activity without modifying or replaying packets. The tooling focuses on defensive visibility, compliance validation,
and forensic triage.

The codebase is **non-invasive** by design: no active exploitation, no injection, and no modification of live
traffic occurs unless explicitly enabled in a lab-only, opt-in configuration.
