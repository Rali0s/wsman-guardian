# Red Teaming & ML Cross-Correlation Report
**Project:** wsman-guardian  
**Author / Team:** Rali0s/3XCypher - CypherArc
**Date:** 2025-10-27  
**Status:** Public-safe summary (sensitive artifacts stored privately)

## Executive summary
Brief one-paragraph summary: scope, goals, and high-level findings. Example:
> We built and trained a Gemini (Vertex AI) model for +/- 6 Hours, and an OpenAI GPT-based assistant to model plausible WS-Man/WinRM workflows, cross-referenced Microsoft PowerShell/.NET docs, and validated theories with OSX Python test harnesses. The work produced defensive indicators and test harnesses to validate DMZ posture and detect ephemeral WMI/WS-MAN/CIM session “chirps”.

## Scope & objectives
- Objectives: (e.g., detect ephemeral WS-MAN/WMI/CIM sessions, validate WSUS exposure, produce defensive detection signatures)
- Boundaries: beta-lab-only, authorized dummy-targets, no production exploitation

## Methodology (high-level)
1. Collected vendor docs (PowerShell module, .NET WS-MAN/WMI/CIM APIs) and formalized key protocol steps.
2. Trained/fine-tuned models ( GeminiPro on VertexAI; OpenAI's GPT; StackOverFlow Notes ) to reason about Workflow logic and produce candidate packet/payload patterns.  
3. Cross-referenced model outputs with knowledge from docs and created OSX py test harnesses to theorize and validate parsing & detection logic.
4. Developed passive-sniffer tooling and pcap extractors for forensic capture.

## Key findings (non-sensitive)
- Detection patterns: ephemeral InstanceId rotation, tight periodic short SOAP bodies, characteristic WS-Addressing Action values — suggested SIEM queries [REDACTED]
- Practical mitigations: host firewall blocks for 8530/8531, rotation of default ports, immediate patching guidance for CVE-2025-59287, and WinRM auth hardening.
- False-positive notes: internal orchestration traffic (SCCM/SCCM-Like/Managed Automation) can look similar — include allowlists by management subnet.

## Artifacts included publicly
- OSX test harnesses (sanitized) in `/experiments/osx-tests`
- Passive sniffing & BPF debug scripts under `/OSX` (no NFQUEUE libs forced)
- High-level model card: `/docs/ML_MODEL_CARD.md`
- Detection rules examples and JSONL sample outputs (sanitized)

## Artifacts withheld (private annex)
- Raw pcaps containing real secrets or target IPs
- Model checkpoints containing proprietary training data or PII
- Any exploit payloads or step-by-step injection procedures

## Responsible disclosure & next steps
- CVE-2025-59287: immediate steps we took (patched/blocking) and timeline (date of patching) - None-Needed.
- Recommend security review prior to public release of detailed artifacts; coordinate with vendor/IR if further exposure suspected.
