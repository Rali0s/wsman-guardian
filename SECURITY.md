## üö® Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security issue or vulnerability:

1. **Do NOT open a public GitHub issue.**
2. Email the maintainers privately at: 3XCypher@pm.me


3. Include:
- A short summary of the issue and its potential impact.
- Steps to reproduce (if applicable).
- Whether it affects the repository‚Äôs code, documentation, or deployment scripts.
- Your contact information for coordinated disclosure.

4. The maintainers will acknowledge receipt within **3 business days** and provide a status update or next steps.

> All disclosures are handled under a coordinated and responsible disclosure model.

## üîí Scope of Security Testing

### In Scope
- The repository‚Äôs own code (Python, PowerShell, shell scripts).
- Configuration and logging behavior that could expose sensitive data.
- False-positive or privacy leaks during traffic capture.

### Out of Scope
- Live attacks, replay testing, or exploitation attempts against third-party systems.
- Unauthorized network interception or packet modification.

> **Reminder:** Use only on systems and networks you own or have explicit written authorization to inspect.

## ‚öôÔ∏è CVE-2025-59287 ‚Äî Reference & Defensive Alignment

- **CVE ID:** CVE-2025-59287  
- **Severity:** Critical (CVSS 9.8)  
- **Type:** Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution in WSUS (Windows Server Update Services)  
- **Status:** Active exploitation observed (Microsoft OOB fix released October 2025)

### Defensive Measures Documented Here
- Guidance to **apply Microsoft OOB updates (KB5070881 / KB5070883 / KB5070882)** immediately.
- Recommendation to **block inbound TCP 8530 / 8531** at host and perimeter firewalls until patched.
- Passive inspection modules (`passive_wsman_nfqueue.py`, `wsman_nfqueue.py`) to help identify suspicious WSUS / WS-Man HTTP traffic without exploitation.
- MITRE ATT&CK mappings for defensive analysts (see `MITRE_MAPPING.md`).

For authoritative remediation details, see:
- Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) advisory for CVE-2025-59287  
- CISA and vendor advisories for current guidance

## üß≠ Coordinated Disclosure Workflow

1. Reporter submits private email to `3XCypher@pm.me`.  
2. Maintainers validate and triage the issue (defensive/non-defensive impact).  
3. If applicable, a GitHub Security Advisory (GHSA) draft is created privately with the reporter.  
4. Fix merged and released with proper attribution (if consented).  
5. Advisory published publicly once a patch or mitigation is available.
